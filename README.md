# Indel-Calling-pipeline
A indel calling pipeline for multiplex-PCR-based target sequencing data

1.HC.py is the indel calling pipeline for processing multiplex-PCR-based target sequencing data.
2.Save_VCF_HC.py is the genotype modifier depending on variant allele frequency.
3.Indel_calls_reporter.py is the vcf parser to extract genotype and depth of indel for each sample.
4.MAF_counter.py is to count minimum allele frequency of interested indel varaint among the sequenced population.
5.mapping_coverage_counter.py is to count the mapping coverage in sam file of each sample.
